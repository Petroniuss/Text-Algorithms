One of the simplest and n a t u r a l types of information representation is by means\n1 . of written texts. This type of d a t a is characterized by t h e fact t h a t it can\n2 . be written down as a long sequence of characters. Such linear a sequence\n3 . is called a text. T h e texts are central in \"word processing\" systems, which\n4 . provide facilities for t h e manipulation of texts. Such systems usually process\n5 . objects t h a t are quite large. For example, this book probably contains more\n6 . t h a n a million characters. Text algorithms occur in many areas of science and\n7 . information processing. Many text editors and programming languages have\n8 . facilities for processing texts. In biology, text algorithms arise in the study\n9 . of molecular sequences. T h e complexity of text algorithms is also one of t h e\n10. central and most studied problems in theoretical computer science. It could\n11. be said t h a t it is the domain in which practice and theory are very close to\n12. each other.\n13. T h e basic textual problem in stringology is called pattern matching. It is\n14. used to access information and, no doubt, at this moment m a n y computers\n15. are solving this problem as a frequently used operation in some application\n16. system. P a t t e r n matching is comparable in this sense to sorting, or to basic\n17. arithmetic operations.\n18. Consider the problem of a reader of the French dictionary \" G r a n d Larousse,\"\n19. who wants all entries related to the n a m e \"Marie-Curie-Sklodowska.\" This is\n20. a n example of a p a t t e r n matching problem, or string matching. In this case,\n21. the n a m e \"Marie-Curie-Sklodowska\" is the p a t t e r n . Generally we m a y want to\n22. find a string called a pattern of length m inside a text of length n, where n is\n23. greater t h a n m. T h e p a t t e r n can be described in a more complex way to denote\n24. a set of strings and not just a single word. In many cases n is very large. In\n25. genetics the p a t t e r n can correspond to a gene t h a t can be very long; in image\n26. \n27. T h e search of words or p a t t e r n s in static texts is quite a different question\n28. t h a n the previous pattern-matching mechanism. Dictionaries, for example,\n29. are organized in order to speed u p the access to entries. Another example\n30. of the same question is given by indexes. Technical books often contain a n\n31. index of chosen terms t h a t gives pointers to p a r t s of the text related to words\n32. in the index. T h e algorithms involved in the creation of an index form a\n33. specific group. T h e use of dictionaries or lexicons is often related t o n a t u r a l\n34. language processing. Lexicons of programming languages are small, and their\n35. representation is not a difficult problem during the development of a compiler.\n36. To the contrary, English contains approximately 100,000 words, a n d even twice\n37. t h a t if inflected forms are considered. In French, inflected forms produce more\n38. t h a n 700,000 words. T h e representation of lexicons of this size makes the\n39. problem a bit more challenging.\n40. A simple use of dictionaries is illustrated by spelling checkers. T h e UNIX\n41. command, spell, reports the words in its input t h a t are not stored in the lexi-\n42. con. This rough approach does not yield a pertinent checker, b u t , practically,\n43. it helps to find typing errors. T h e lexicon used by spell contains approxi-\n44. mately 70,000 entries stored within less t h a n 60 kilobytes of random-access\n45. memory. Quick access to lexicons is a necessary condition for producing good\n46. parsers. T h e d a t a structure useful for such access is called an index. In our\n47. book indexes correspond to d a t a structures representing all factors of a given\n48. (presumably long) text. We consider problems related to the construction of\n49. such structures: suffix t r e e s , d i r e c t e d a c y c l i c w o r d g r a p h s , f a c t o r a u -\n50. t o m a t a , suffix arrays. T h e PAT\n51. tool developed at the N O E D Center\n52. (Waterloo, Canada) is an implementation of one of these structures tailored\n53. to work on large texts. There are several applications t h a t effectively require\n54. some understanding of phrases in n a t u r a l languages, such as d a t a retrieval\n55. systems, interactive software, a n d character recognition.\n56. An image scanner is a kind of photocopier. It is used to give a digitized\n57. version of a n image. W h e n the image is a page of text, the n a t u r a l o u t p u t of the\n58. scanner must be in a digital form available to a text editor. T h e transformation\n59. of a digitized image of a text into a usual computer representation of the text\n60. is realized by a n Optical Character Recognition ( O C R ) . Scanning a text with\n61. an O C R can be 50 times faster t h a n retyping the text on a keyboard. T h u s ,\n62. O C R softwares are likely to become more common. B u t they still suffer from\n63. a high degree of imprecision. T h e average rate of error in the recognition of\n64. characters is approximately one percent. Even if this may h a p p e n to be rather\n65. small, this means t h a t scanning a book produces approximately one error per\n66. line. This is compared with the usually very high quality of texts checked\n67. by specialists. Technical improvements on the hardware can help eliminate\n68. certain kinds of errors occurring on scanned texts in printed forms. But this\n69. cannot alleviate the problem associated with recognizing texts in printed forms.\n70. Reduction of the number of errors can thus only be achieved by considering the\n71. context of the characters, which assumes some understanding of the structure\n72. of the text. Image processing is related to the problem of two-dimensional\n73. pattern matching. Another related problem is the data structure for all\n74. subimages, which is discussed in this book in the context of the dictionary\n75. of basic factors.\n76. The theoretical approach to the representation of lexicons is either by means\n77. of trees or finite state automata. It appears that both approaches are equally\n78. efficient. This shows the practical importance of the automata theoretic\n79. approach to text problems. At LITP (Paris) and IGM (Marne-la-Vallee)\n80. we have shown that the use of automata to represent lexicons is particularly\n81. efficient. Experiments have been done on a 700,000 word lexicon of LADL\n82. (Paris). The representation supports direct access to any word of the lexicon\n83. and takes only 300 kilobytes of random-access memory.\n84. \n"
