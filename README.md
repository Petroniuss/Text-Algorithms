# Text-Algorithms

Class completed during 4th semester of studying computer science at AGH.

Overview of laboratories:
 1. finding patterns in strings:
  - naive
  - finite automata
  - kmp
 2. complex data structures:  
  - building trie and suffix tree based on McCreight algorithm
 3. compression: 
  - static Huffman
  - dynamic Huffman
 4. edit distance:
  - animation of the algorithm
  - implementation of diff (popular linux command)
 5. finiding two diemnsional patterns:
  - implementation of Aho-Corasick and Bird&Baker to find all occurences of a letter within image
 6. once again finding patterns in strings: 
  - DBF and Karp-Miller-Rosenberg Algorithm 
 7. implementation of regex engine 
  - obviously this is rather simple one and I implemented only a subset of regex operators 
  though result is still satisfactory :)
  
  Every folder should contain report.ipynb file which shows some example of working algorithm.
